 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430F(G)47x Demo - Timer_B, Toggle P4.6, Overflow ISR, DCO SMCLK
//
//  Description: This program toggles P4.6 using software and the Timer_B
//  overflow ISR. In this example an ISR triggers when TB overflows.
//  Inside the ISR P4.6 is toggled.  Toggle rate is 16Hz when using default
//  FLL+ register settings and an external 32kHz watch crystal.
//  Proper use of TBIV interrupt vector generator is demonstrated.
//  ACLK = LFXT1 = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO = 32 x ACLK = 1048576Hz
//  //* An external watch crystal between XIN & XOUT is required for ACLK *//
