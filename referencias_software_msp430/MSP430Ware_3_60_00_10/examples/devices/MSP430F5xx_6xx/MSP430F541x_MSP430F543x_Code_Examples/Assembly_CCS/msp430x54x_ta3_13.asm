;                        MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
; 
;  MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
;  demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
;  concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
;  register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
;  be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
;  effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
;  for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

;  MSP430F54x Demo - Timer_A3, Toggle P2.1/TA1.0, Up/Down Mode, DCO SMCLK
;
;  Description: Toggle P2.1 using hardware TA1.0 output. Timer1_A is configured
;  for up/down mode with CCR0 defining period, TA1.0 also output on P1.1. In
;  this example, CCR0 is loaded with 250 and TA1.0 will toggle P1.1 at
;  TACLK/2*250. Thus the output frequency on P1.1 will be the TACLK/1000.
;  No CPU or software resources required.
;  As coded with TACLK = SMCLK, P2.1 output frequency is ~1.045M/1000.
;  SMCLK = MCLK = TACLK = default DCO ~1.045MHz
