            "description": "<p>TI-RTOS accelerates development schedules by eliminating the need to create basic system software functions from scratch. TI-RTOS scales from a real-time multitasking kernel - TI-RTOS Kernel (formerly known as SYS/BIOS) - to a complete RTOS solution including additional middleware components, device drivers and power management. The combination of TI-RTOS power management and TI's ultra low-power MCUs enables developers to design applications with much longer battery life. By providing essential system software components pre-tested and pre-integrated, TI-RTOS enables developers to focus on differentiating their application.</p><p>TI-RTOS builds on existing proven software components to ensure reliability and quality. It augments these with documentation, additional examples and APIs appropriate for multitasking development and integration testing to verify that all components work together. TI-RTOS is fully tested with the Code Composer Studio™ Integrated Development Environment (CCS IDE). For some microcontroller platforms, TI-RTOS includes libraries that work with the IAR Embedded Workbench IDE and GCC.</p>",
