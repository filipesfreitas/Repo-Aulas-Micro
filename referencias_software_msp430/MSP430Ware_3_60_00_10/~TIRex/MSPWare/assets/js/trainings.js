Automatic MSP432 Software in ROM debugging is included within Code IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM 7.40.5 or newer version.",

The challenge many developers face today is maintaining or improving battery operating life while simultaneously increasing a device’s capabilities. For many devices, it is not feasible to increase battery size or capacity; this means that developers need to achieve higher performance within the same power footprint, if battery life is not to be compromised.",

As a consequence a single FRAM based microcontroller can be customized for a wide range of application use cases. To prevent accidental overwrites of the program by application data or other forms of data corruption, the Memory Protection Unit (MPU) allows partitioning of the available memory and defining access rights for each of the partitions. Code Composer Studio™ and IAR Embedded Workbench® for MSP430 IDEs can both be used to set up an application’s memory layout to make best-possible use of the underlying FRAM depending on the application needs.",

This may include both the application code itself as well as configuration settings for certain peripherals. The IPE module allows the protection of memory that contains this kind of sensitive information. The Intellectual Property Encapsulation IPE ensures that only program code that is itself placed in the IPE protected area has access to this memory segment.",
