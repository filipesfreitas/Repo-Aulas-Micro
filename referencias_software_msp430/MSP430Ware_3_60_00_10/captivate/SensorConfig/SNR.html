        <P>When connected to the target, the Measure SNR button will initiate a series of
        measurements on the highlighted element and perform the calculations described 
        above and update the table accordingly.  Additional options are available to 
        adjust the sample size, apply filtering, and log the entire dataset.

        <li><B>Filtering Enabled</B>
        <P>Selecting this option applies the Count Filter settings found in the Tuning Tab.  
        This filter can impact the SNR results.  Please refer to the Filter Count Beta and 
        Enable options found in the Tuning Tab.  The default, unselected, state disables
        the Count Filter.</li>

        <P>The sample size is the number of samples taken during the touch portion of the 
        test and the release portion of the test.</li>
        <li><B>Export CSV</B>
        <P>Export the entire sample set for the next measurement to the SNR.csv file.</li>       
        <li><B>Overwrite CSV</B>
        <P>Overwrite the existing SNR.csv file.  If this option is not selected, then each
        measurement is appended to the existing SNR.csv file.</li>
