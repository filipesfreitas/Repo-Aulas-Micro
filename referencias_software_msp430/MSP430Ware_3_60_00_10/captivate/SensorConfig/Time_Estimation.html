		<B>Scan Time Estimator</B><BR>
		The scan time estimator calculates the nominal conversion time for each sensor in the system.
		This provides insight into how long it takes to measure each sensor individually, as well as the user interface
		as a whole.
		
		<P>
		<B>Using the Scan Time Estimator</B><BR>
		The conversion time for a sensor may be used as a reference when optimizing a design for lowest power consumption.
		As shown in the formula below, the time it takes to run the conversion is a function of how the conversion control
		parameters are set up for each sensor.  Decreasing the conversion count value decreases the conversion time, as does increasing the
		conversion clock frequency by adjusting the frequency divider and phase lengths.  The conversion time has a direct impact
		on the amount of power used during the conversion (a longer conversion time implies a higher power consumption).
		<P>
		Knowing the overall conversion time for the user interface can be helpful in situations when the system report rate needs to be optimized.
		By comparing the <I>Scan Period</I> line on the plot to the <I>Sensors Total</I> line, it's possible to obtain an estimate of the amount of
		time available after all the sensors in the system are measured.  As the System Report Rate parameter is decreased, the user interface
		will be measured more often, and the amount of available time will decrease.  Note that the more often the user interface is measured, the
		higher the power consumption will be.
		
		<P>
		<B>Limitations</B><BR>
		- The estimator only calculates the conversion time itself.  It does not take into account 
		the time needed by the software library to process the measurement and call the user callback.  This processing time
		may become significant as the report rate goes up (this is equivalent to the scan period going down).
		<BR>
		- The estimator does not take into account the amount of time needed to transmit the status of the user interface via
		the selected communication interface (UART or I2C).  This timing is application dependent.
		<BR>
		- The conversion time of a self capacitance sensor goes down when that sensor is interacted with.  This is not
		accounted for scan time estimator.
		<BR>
		- The conversion time of a mutual capacitance sensor goes up when that sensor is interacted with.  This is not
		accounted for in the scan time estimator.
