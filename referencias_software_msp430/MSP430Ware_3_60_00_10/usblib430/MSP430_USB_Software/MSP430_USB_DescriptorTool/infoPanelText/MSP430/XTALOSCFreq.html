        <h1>XT2 Oscillator Frequency</h1>
        <p>Associated constant in the API stacks:  <span class="attribute">USB_XT_FREQ</span>. (Not reported in the USB descriptors.)  </p>
        <p>This value must match the frequency of the crystal, resonator, or clock applied to the XT2 oscillator.  </p>
        <p>The API enables the XT2 oscillator when USB is active, and optionally disables it during USB suspend.  It uses XT2 as a reference to the USB PLL.</p>
        <p>XT2 needs one of these applied to it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a crystal/resonator (minimum of 4MHz)
            </li>
            <li>
                a clock signal from elsewhere on the board, via XT2's "bypass" mode (minimum of 1.5MHz)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many input frequencies are possible, allowing cost reduction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                maybe the clock is available elsewhere on the board, saving the cost of the crystal. 
            </li>
            <li>
                maybe another device on the board can use the MSP430's clock, saving the cost of the crystal. 
            </li>
            <li>
                a crystal can be chosen based on the lowest cost.  
            </li>
        </ul>
